### Key Architectural Principles
1. **API owns ALL business logic** - Apps are view layers only
2. **Single source of truth** - All data lives in API database
3. **Offline-first design** - Techs work in poor connectivity
4. **AI-ready architecture** - Structured for Gemini/Claude integration
5. **Platform mindset** - Scales to thousands of techs/customers

## 📱 THREE CORE APPLICATIONS

### 1. TECH APP (PWA) - Currently Building
**Purpose**: Enable technicians to perform onboardings and manage their work

**Key Features**:
- Route-based offer management (30-min exclusive, 2-min undo)
- 6-step onboarding flow:
  1. Quick Start (customer info verification)
  2. Water Analysis (13 chemistry fields)
  3. Pool Profile (dimensions, features, environment)
  4. Equipment Scan (6 categories with AI photo analysis)
  5. Voice Notes (MANDATORY 30s-3min)
  6. Complete
- Offline queue with automatic sync
- Real-time earnings tracker
- Performance metrics dashboard

**Critical Requirements**:
- Must work offline in backyards
- Voice notes are MANDATORY (captures nuanced observations)
- Equipment photos analyzed by Gemini Vision
- All data syncs when connection returns

### 2. CUSTOMER APP (PWA) - Not Started
**Purpose**: Customer onboarding journey and ongoing service management

**Customer Journey**:
1. **Pre-Onboarding**:
   - Download app after booking
   - Answer initial pool questions
   - Track onboarding status

2. **Post-Onboarding**:
   - View AI-generated report
   - Approve/decline repairs
   - Select membership tier
   - Digital signatures
   - Payment authorization

3. **Active Service**:
   - Weekly AI Insights Reports
   - Pool health score (0-100)
   - Chemistry tracking with trends
   - Equipment monitoring
   - Chat with CSM
   - One-tap tech rating

### 3. CSM DASHBOARD - Not Started
**Purpose**: Minimal oversight platform for Customer Success Managers

**Key Features**:
- Review AI reports before customer delivery
- Adjust AI-generated pricing
- Monitor tech performance
- Handle escalations
- Train AI with corrections

## 🤖 AI SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE

### 1. Pricing AI (Claude)
- **Learns from**: Every CSM correction
- **Factors**: Pool size, equipment condition, foliage, location
- **Output**: Monthly membership price + repair estimates
- **Goal**: <5% pricing adjustments needed

### 2. Equipment Vision AI (Gemini)
- **Input**: Equipment photos
- **Output**: Brand, model, condition, age estimate
- **Features**: Auto-populate forms, identify repair needs

### 3. Voice Analysis AI (Claude)
- **Input**: 30s-3min voice recordings
- **Output**: Transcription + key insights
- **Purpose**: Capture nuanced observations for pricing

### 4. Predictive Chemistry AI
- **Inputs**: Historical data, weather, foliage, usage
- **Outputs**: Chemistry forecasts, preventive recommendations
- **Value**: Proactive vs reactive service

### 5. Weekly Insights AI (Claude)
- **Generates**: Plain English pool explanations
- **Includes**: What happened, what's coming, educational content
- **Goal**: Customers understand their pool

## 🔄 COMPLETE DATA FLOW

### Onboarding Flow
1. Customer books on website
2. Booking creates Poolbrain customer
3. System assigns best tech (proximity + rating)
4. Tech accepts offer (30-min exclusive)
5. Tech performs onboarding:
   - Verify customer info
   - Test water chemistry
   - Document pool details
   - Photograph all equipment → Gemini Vision
   - Record voice observations → Claude
6. AI analyzes everything → Report
7. CSM reviews/adjusts → Customer sees
8. Customer approves service → Route activation

## 📊 KEY ALGORITHMS

### Tech Assignment Algorithm
```
Score = (0.6 × proximityScore) + (0.4 × ratingScore)
```
- Proximity: Distance from customer to tech's route
- Rating: 1-5 star average
- Sort by score, offer to highest first
- 30-minute exclusive offer window

### Rating System Tiers
- Bronze: <4.0 stars
- Silver: 4.0-4.5 stars
- Gold: 4.5-4.8 stars
- Elite: 4.8+ stars

## 🚀 PLATFORM SCALING STRATEGY

- NestJS for API backend
- PostgreSQL for database
- Feature flags for gradual rollout
- Comprehensive error handling
- API integration tracking with [API-INTEGRATION] markers

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Building logic in apps (belongs in API)
- Direct AI service calls from apps
- Assuming good connectivity
- Hardcoding configurations
- Ignoring error cases

## 🔗 INTEGRATION TRACKING

All integration points marked with:
```javascript
// [API-INTEGRATION: Feature - Priority #]
// Sends to: [App names]
// Receives from: [App names]
// Poolbrain sync: [Yes/No]
```
