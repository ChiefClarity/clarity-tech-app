# Real API Authentication Fix Summary

## Problem
The app was still using mock authentication instead of the real API, even with environment variables set.

## Root Cause
The auth service was checking `FEATURES.USE_REAL_AUTH` flag which was reading from environment variables, but the mock logic was still present and being triggered.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Forced Real API in Auth Service** (`src/services/api/auth.ts`)
- Removed ALL mock authentication logic
- Removed feature flag checks (`FEATURES.USE_REAL_AUTH`)
- Auth service now ALWAYS uses the real API at `https://clarity-pool-api.onrender.com/api/auth/technician/login`
- Added detailed console logging to track authentication flow

### 2. **Added Environment Debugging** (`App.tsx`)
- Added console logs to show which environment variables are loaded
- Shows API base URL and auth settings on app startup

### 3. **Removed Mock Logic from:**
- Login method - now always calls real API
- Refresh token method - removed test token bypass
- Logout method - removed feature flag check

## What Happens Now

1. **On Login Attempt:**
   - Console shows: `üîê Attempting login to: https://clarity-pool-api.onrender.com/api/auth/technician/login`
   - Console shows the email being used
   - Makes a real POST request to the API
   - Shows response status and details

2. **Expected Responses:**
   - **Success (200)**: User exists in Supabase and credentials are correct
   - **Unauthorized (401)**: Invalid credentials
   - **Not Found (404)**: User doesn't exist in database
   - **Server Error (500)**: API issue

3. **No More Mock Mode:**
   - The test account (test@claritypool.com) will NOT work unless it exists in Supabase
   - All authentication goes through the real API
   - Token storage and refresh use real tokens from the API

## Testing Steps

1. Refresh/restart the app
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Try logging in with any credentials
4. Check console for:
   - API URL being called
   - Login response details
   - Success or error messages
5. Check Network tab for the actual POST request

## Next Steps

If login fails with 404:
- The technician needs to be created in Supabase first
- Use the admin panel to create technician accounts

If login fails with 401:
- Check password is correct
- Verify the technician's status is active in database

If login succeeds:
- Real token will be stored
- App will use this token for all subsequent API calls
