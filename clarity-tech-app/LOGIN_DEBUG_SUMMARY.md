# Login Debug Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Auth Service (src/services/api/auth.ts)
- Added direct fetch call to bypass any axios interceptors and see raw API response
- Added logic to handle different response formats:
  - If API returns `{ success: true, data: {...} }` format, use as-is
  - If API returns `{ user: {...}, token: "...", refreshToken: "..." }` directly, wrap it in ApiResponse format
  - If API returns error or unexpected format, handle appropriately
- Added comprehensive logging to track data transformation

### 2. Enhanced AuthContext (src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx)
- Added detailed logging throughout the login flow
- Added validation checks for user object (null/undefined checks)
- Added logging for auth state updates

## Key Debugging Points

The enhanced logging will show:
1. **Direct API Response** - What the server actually returns before any transformations
2. **Response Format Detection** - Whether response needs wrapping or is already in correct format
3. **User Object Validation** - Checks for all required user fields
4. **Error Details** - Full stack traces and error types

## Expected Log Output

When you run the app and try to login, you'll see:
```
üîê Attempting login to: https://clarity-pool-api.onrender.com/api/auth/technician/login
üìß Email: [user email]
üì° Direct API response: [full JSON response]
üì° Direct API response type: object
üì° Direct API response keys: [array of keys]
[AUTH CONTEXT] Starting login...
[AUTH CONTEXT] Login service response: [formatted response]
...
```

## Next Steps

1. Run the app and attempt login
2. Check the console logs to see the exact API response format
3. The code will now handle both possible response formats automatically
4. If there are still issues, the logs will pinpoint exactly where the problem occurs
